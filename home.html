         <h2 style="text-align: center;"> What is smart parking?</h2>
   Smart parking completely removes the guesswork of the parking experience. For the last 135 or so years, since the invention of the car, drivers have relied on instinct or luck to locate an available parking space.<br>
Smart parking is 3 main -   <br>
<li>
    <ul>
        <li>Real-time data and guidance to drivers so they can locate the best available parking space quickly.</li>
        <li>Parking asset control for cities, operators and facility management so they can understand occupancy, payment compliance and much more.</li>
        <li>A direct way to affect climate change with cars searching for parking less so we have a sustainable future on this planet.</li>
    </ul>
</li>

    <li>Ground sensor technology</li>
    <li>Counter technology</li>
    <li>Overhead sensor or camera-based technology</li>
</ul></div>

    <h2 style="text-align: center;">Benefits of smart parking</h2>
    <p>We have touched on some inherent benefits up till now, but here is a list of the top benefits why to consider deploying a smart parking solution:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reduces unnecessary vehicle emissions caused by parking search traffic</li>
        <li>Saves time and hassle for drivers to find (and pay) for their ideal parking space quickly and easily</li>
        <li>Generates data that can be leveraged to connect other modes of transportation - hints the concept of a mobility hub. Such as ride-sharing, bike hire, scooters or public transportation.</li>
